📊 Supply Chain Analytics — Power BI

Project: FMCG Supply Chain Control Tower

Context:
Academic case study simulating FMCG supply chain operations, with emphasis on service levels, stockouts, revenue performance, and logistics efficiency.

Objective:
• Identify root causes of stockouts and delivery delays  
• Monitor OTIF, revenue, and cost-to-serve across regions and warehouses  
• Enable operational decision-making using interactive dashboards  

What I built:
• End-to-end Supply Chain Control Tower in Power BI  
• KPI cards tracking Stockout Rate, OTIF %, and Total Revenue  
• Time-series analysis of revenue and service-level trends  
• Root cause analysis using Key Influencers and decomposition views  
• Warehouse- and region-level performance comparison  

Key Insights:
• Delivery delays (>5 days) are the strongest driver of increased transportation cost  
• OTIF performance deteriorates significantly during logistics delays  
• A small number of warehouses disproportionately impact overall service levels
