## 📊 Financial News Sentiment Analysis (Python, NLP)

**Objective:**  
Built a Python-based market intelligence system to analyze large-scale financial news and extract sentiment-driven investment insights.

**What I did:**
- Processed 1,000+ financial news articles using NLP
- Performed sentiment analysis and topic modeling
- Identified dominant market themes and sentiment bias
- Converted unstructured news into decision-ready insights

**Key Insights:**
- Market sentiment showed cautious optimism
- Earnings and trading activity dominated news coverage
- Regulatory and crypto-related topics indicated risk clusters

**Impact:**
- Reduced manual analysis time by ~90%
- Enabled faster, data-driven investment decisions

## 📊 Supply Chain Analytics — Power BI

**Project:** FMCG Supply Chain Control Tower

**Context:**
Academic case study simulating FMCG supply chain operations, with emphasis on service levels, stockouts, revenue performance, and logistics efficiency.

**Objective:**
• Identify root causes of stockouts and delivery delays  
• Monitor OTIF, revenue, and cost-to-serve across regions and warehouses  
• Enable operational decision-making using interactive dashboards  

**What I built:**
• End-to-end Supply Chain Control Tower in Power BI  
• KPI cards tracking Stockout Rate, OTIF %, and Total Revenue  
• Time-series analysis of revenue and service-level trends  
• Root cause analysis using Key Influencers and decomposition views  
• Warehouse- and region-level performance comparison  

**Key Insights:**
• Delivery delays (>5 days) are the strongest driver of increased transportation cost  
• OTIF performance deteriorates significantly during logistics delays  
• A small number of warehouses disproportionately impact overall service levels

## 📈 Python Quantitative Finance Toolkit

**Objective:**
Built a Python-based toolkit to analyze stock returns, portfolio risk, and financial uncertainty using quantitative finance techniques.

**What I did:**
• Portfolio optimization using Efficient Frontier
• Risk & volatility analysis
• Regression and multivariate modeling
• Monte Carlo simulations for price prediction and option valuation

**Key Insights:**
• Diversification improves risk-adjusted returns
• Financial relationships are unstable under stress
• Monte Carlo simulations capture market uncertainty better than point estimates

## 🤖 FinTech Robo-Advisor — Retirement Planning

**Objective**  
Developed a digital retirement planning Robo-Advisor to estimate inflation-adjusted retirement corpus and required monthly SIP using real-world financial logic.

**Highlights**  
• Inflation-adjusted retirement corpus estimation using real returns  
• SIP calculation based on annuity-style cash flow modeling  
• Precision benchmarking against Excel financial models  
• Responsive, production-ready web interface  

**Key Insight**
Even small numerical precision errors can materially impact long-term financial outcomes, making validation and accuracy critical in FinTech applications.

## 🤖 Fraud & Risk Analytics — Credit Card Fraud Detection (ML)

**Objective**  
Built a machine learning solution to detect fraudulent credit card transactions while minimizing false positives and customer disruption.

**Highlights** 
• Extreme class imbalance handling (<0.2% fraud rate)  
• Model comparison: Logistic Regression vs Random Forest  
• Business-driven metric selection (Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC)  
• Recommendation based on customer experience, not just accuracy  

**Key Insight**  
Random Forest significantly reduces false positives compared to Logistic Regression, making it more suitable for real-world fraud prevention systems.
